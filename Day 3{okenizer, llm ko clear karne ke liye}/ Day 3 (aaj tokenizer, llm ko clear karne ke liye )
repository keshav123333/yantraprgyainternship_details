Text Representation

Bag of Words (BoW): Representing text as a collection of words while ignoring grammar and word order.

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Measures the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus).

Sentiment Analysis
NLTK can be used for sentiment analysis, which classifies text into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral based on its sentiment.

Example: Using NLTK's VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) for sentiment analysis of customer reviews or social media posts.

Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Identifying proper names (people, places, organizations) from the text.

Example:

Text Classification
NLTK can classify text into predefined categories, such as spam detection or topic classification.

Example: Classifying a news article as 'sports', 'politics', 'technology', etc.

WordNet
NLTK integrates with WordNet, a lexical database of English, to find synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms (more general terms), and hyponyms (more specific terms) for words.

Example:

Synonyms for "happy": joyful, content

Antonyms for "happy": sad, miserable
